# USQL Parsing Library

As of right now, this is a library of grammars for parsing TSQl. At worst, we can use the
usql grammar for parsing TSQL as these grammars are complete for TSQL at 2008R2. At best though,
we can modify the USQL grammar to be a universal SQL parser, with or without a universal set of
walkers.
